This is a SageMaker Autopilot Pipeline. I took the data from an older course that I took, for an employee attrition binary classification project. I wanted to see how AutoPilot would hand the data pre-processing, as well as how it would choose the best models and hyperparameters. 

I used human resources data, and generated two notebooks:

1) Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot Candidate Definition Notebook
2) Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot Data Exploration Notebook
