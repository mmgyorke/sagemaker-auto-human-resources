For this project, I implemented a SageMaker Autopilot Pipeline on Human Resources Department data. The data comes from a case study on employee attrition, from a Udemy course that I took back in 2020. I recently came across my notebook from that course, and just for fun, I thought i would run the data through an Autopilot training job. I was curious how AutoML would tackle the data preprocessing as well as the model selection. 

This repo contains: 

1) Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot Candidate Definition Notebook
